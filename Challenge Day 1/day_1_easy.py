# Even or Odd
# By Markus Gulla

# Hello everyone!!!! Welcome to the first programming challenge of the club!
# In today's challenge, you will be creating a function that receives an integer as an argument and returns 
# "Even" for even numbers and "Odd" for odd numbers. 

def even_or_odd(x):
    # WRITE YOUR CODE HERE

    return 0



t1 = 13
t2 = 0
t3 = 2
t4 = 57
t5 = 578

test_one = even_or_odd(t1)
print(t1,"is ODD --- YOUR CODE RETURNED:",test_one)

test_two = even_or_odd(t2)
print(t2,"is EVEN --- YOUR CODE RETURNED:",test_two)

test_three = even_or_odd(t3)
print(t3,"is EVEN --- YOUR CODE RETURNED:",test_three)

test_four = even_or_odd(t4)
print(t4,"is ODD --- YOUR CODE RETURNED:",test_four)

test_five = even_or_odd(t5)
print(t5,"is EVEN --- YOUR CODE RETURNED:",test_five)
