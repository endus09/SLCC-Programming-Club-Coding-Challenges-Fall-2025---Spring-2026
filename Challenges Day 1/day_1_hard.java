/*
 * Valid Phone Number
 * by Markus Gulla
 * 
 * Hello everyone!!!! Welcome to the first programming challenge of the club!
 * In today's challenge, you will be creating a function that receives a string, and returns true if it is in the form of a phone number.
 * Assume that any integer from 0 to 9 in any of the spots will produce a valid phone number.
 * 
 * Here is the following format:
 * 
 *       (123) 456-7890
 * 
 * Do not forget the space after the closed parentheses!
