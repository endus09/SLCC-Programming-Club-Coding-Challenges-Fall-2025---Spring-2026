# Twice as Old
# By Markus Gulla

# Welcome to the third programming challenge of the club!
# In today's challenge, you will be creating a function that receives two integers
# (fathers age and sons age). You will need to calculate how many years ago the father
# was twice as old as his son (or in how many years he will be twice as old).
# Your answer needs to be greater than or equal to zero.

# EXAMPLE:

# Input:
# twice_as_old(50, 10)

# Output:
# 30

def twice_as_old(father_age, son_age):
    #WRITE YOUR CODE HERE
    return

print("YOUR ANSWER---")
twice_as_old(50,10)
print("EXPECTED---\n30\n")

print("YOUR ANSWER---")
twice_as_old(32,13)
print("EXPECTED---\n6\n")

print("YOUR ANSWER---")
twice_as_old(51,30)
print("EXPECTED---\n9\n")

print("YOUR ANSWER---")
twice_as_old(47,24)
print("EXPECTED---\n1\n")

print("YOUR ANSWER---")
twice_as_old(40,20)
print("EXPECTED---\n0\n")
