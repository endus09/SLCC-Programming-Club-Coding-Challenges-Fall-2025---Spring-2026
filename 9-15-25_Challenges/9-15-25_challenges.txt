HARD CHALLENGE:

Valid Phone Number
by Markus Gulla & Bryson Crader
 
Hello everyone!!!! Welcome to the first programming challenge of the club!
In today's challenge, you will be creating a function that receives a string, and returns true if it is in the form of a phone number.
Assume that any integer from 0 to 9 in any of the spots will produce a valid phone number.

Here is the following format:
 
     (123) 456-7890

Do not forget the space after the closed parentheses!

Once you have programmed the solution, test your function on these Strings:

"(1234) 213-5543";  - returns false
"(123)-456-7890";   - returns false
"Hello world";      - returns false
"(123) 456-78901";  - returns false
"(321) 654-9870";   - returns true
"(123) 456-7890";   - returns true
